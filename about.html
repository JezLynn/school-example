        <h1 class="header">Led by brothers Andrew and Mark O'Keeffee, we are a boutique brand communications agency where yout get to deal directly with the creatives.</h1>
        <p>We pride ourselves on our process, our craft and our attention to detail. We also put a lot of time into nurturing our relations with our clients. We believe in charm, good manners and punctuality. And a healthy dose of humour – we take pride in our work, but don’t take ourselves too seriously.
We’re agile, flexible, nimble, responsive and adaptive. There’s no agency hierarchy to trip over, no juniors making decisions about your brand or learning on your time – just a dedicated group of people who are all across, and focused on, your project.</p>

            <h1>Eunice Yip</h1>
            <p>Trained as a visual communicator, moonlighting as a one-time illustrator, some would say Eunice sees the world through a slightly different lens. Originally hailing from the treacherous jungles of South East Asia, she now calls Australia (and Studio Alto) home, where she spends her days nitpicking bad kerning and resolving typographic dilemmas.</p>

            <p>Straight out of New Zealand (via Europe), Lauren has honed her skills in the chillier parts of the Northern Hemisphere, keeping world class design and advertising agencies on time and on track.</p>
